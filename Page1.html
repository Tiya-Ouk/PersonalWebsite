<p> One of my interest is streetwear fashion. I really enjoy the look and comfort that it provides for me. Before I got into clothing I started off collecting retro jordans. I remember the first pair of retro jordans I received from my dad, they were the retro aqua 8's. After receiving the sneakers I became obsessed. A few years later I was introduced to streetwear. My favorite aspect about streetwear is the fact that it is unisex for the most part. My sense of style doesn't fit between femimine or masculine its a bit of both, so when streetwear came to my attention I was hooked. </p>

<h2> Hobbies </h2>
<ul>
<li> collecting sneakers and streetwear </li>
<li> fishing </li>
<li> camping </li>
<li> drawing </li>
</ul>
<p> When I was younger I was outside 24/7, I loved it! My brother and I would hang out with our uncles all the time and what they liked to do eventually rubbed off on us too lol. Pretty much every weekend when the weather was nice we would plan a camping trip. Since we were out camping there was most likely a lake or dam near by. We fished all the time and would take our catches back to our campsite, gut the fish, clean them up, season them, and finally cook and eat it, yummy! But if the weather was not pleasurable to be in we would stay inside and play video games or draw.</p>
